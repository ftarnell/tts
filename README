RT/TTS - Time-tracking software
===============================

RT/TTS is a simple, text-based (curses) time-tracking application.  For more
details, see the website at <http://www.rt.uk.eu.org/~river/pages/tts>.

RT/TTS has been tested on FreeBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, Cygwin and Linux, with the
following caveats:

	- Wide character support does not work with Unicode using Solaris
	  curses, which appears to only support EUC.  Use ncurses instead.

	- Wide character support does not work at all on Cygwin; TTS must
	  be compiled with --without-ncursesw.  Patches welcome.

TTS uses autoconf and can be built as follows:

	$ ./configure
	$ make
	# make install
